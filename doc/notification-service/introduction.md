# Notification Service Introduction

---

A notification can be defined in general as a piece of conclusive information passed to a specific receiver about the occurrence of an event in an application. A notification can be in the form of an email, message push, text to chat system, or a trigger to open a ticket. Most of the time, aÂ notification does not require a response or acknowledgement to the sender.

The Ericsson Notification Service (ENS) provides a way to collect events published
by other applications on a message bus. The events that are read from the message bus are processed and transformed into notifications. The notifications are reported as REST messages to a set of subscribed clients. 

Client applications can register themselves to ENS by creating "subscriptions".
Notifications are sent only to clients which have at least one subscription 
matching an event through a set of criteria defined in the subscription itself.


This Notification Service documentation includes the [Concepts](concept.md) you will need
to understand before using the Notification Service. 
Notification Service [Dependencies](dependencies.md)
are listed, and instructions for using the Notification Service are provided in the
[Developer Guide](developer-guide.md) and [Use Cases](use-case.md).
